# Steve's Sandwich Site

## Purpose

The main purpose of this exercise is to get some practice using html.
In the coming weeks, we will flesh the site out and see how far we can take it!

## Things to remember

- Tags

  - Most tags have an opening and closing tag, but some tags are self-closing.
  - tags we learned:
    - Header tags: h1-h6 (h1 is the biggest)
    - paragraphs `<p>`
    - images `<img src="http://placeholder-location">`
    - links `<a href="http://example.com">`
    - lists:
      - ordered lists `<ol>` a list with numbers
      - unordered lists `<ul>` a list with bullets
      - list items `<li>` each item should be wrapped in a list item tag.
    - styling tags:
      - strong `<strong>` for bold text
      - emphasis `<em>` for italics
      - breaks `<br/>` self-closing tag for starting a new line
